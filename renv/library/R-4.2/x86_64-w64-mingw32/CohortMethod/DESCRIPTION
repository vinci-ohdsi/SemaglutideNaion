Description: Functions for performing new-user cohort studies in an observational database in the OMOP Common Data Model. Can extract the necessary data from a database and use a large set of covariates for both the  propensity and outcome model, including for example all drugs, diagnoses, procedures,  as well as age, comorbidity indexes, etc. Large scale regularized regression is used to  fit the propensity and outcome models. Functions are included for trimming, stratifying,  (variable and fixed ratio) matching and weighting by propensity scores, as well as  diagnostic functions, such as propensity score distribution plots and plots showing  covariate balance before and after matching and/or trimming. Supported outcome models  are (conditional) logistic regression, (conditional) Poisson regression, and  (stratified) Cox regression. Also included are Kaplan-Meier plots that can adjust for  the stratification or matching.
